```sql
select
  name as server_name,
  id as server_id,
  configurations ->> 'Name' as configuration_name,
  configurations -> 'ConfigurationProperties' ->> 'value' as value
from
  azure_mysql_server,
  jsonb_array_elements(server_configurations) as configurations
where 
   configurations ->> 'Name' = 'audit_log_enabled';
```

### List servers with slow_query_log parameter enabled

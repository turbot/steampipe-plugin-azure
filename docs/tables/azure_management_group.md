# Table: azure_management_group

Management groups provide a governance scope above subscriptions. You organize subscriptions into management groups in the governance conditions you apply cascade by inheritance to all associated subscriptions. Management groups give you enterprise-grade management at a scale no matter what type of subscriptions you might have. However, all subscriptions within a single management group must trust the same Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant.

Note: To query this table, you need to have at least read access to the specific management group.

# Table: azure_provider

A Azure Resource Provider (RP, for short) is simply an HTTPS RESTful API contract that Add-on owners will implement so a trusted Azure endpoint can provision, delete, and manage services on a user's behalf.

## Examples

### Basic info

```sql
select
  id,
  namespace,
  registration_state
from
  azure_provider;
```

### List of azure providers which are not registered for use

```sql
select
  namespace,
  registration_state
from
  azure_provider
where
  registration_state = 'NotRegistered';
```

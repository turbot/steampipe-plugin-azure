# Table: azure_kubernetes_service_version

Azure AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service) orchestrator is a managed container orchestration service provided by Microsoft Azure. It simplifies the deployment, management, and scaling of containerized applications using Kubernetes. AKS allows you to deploy and manage containerized applications without the need to manage the underlying infrastructure. It provides automated Kubernetes upgrades, built-in monitoring and diagnostics, and seamless integration with other Azure services. AKS enables developers and DevOps teams to focus on application development and deployment, while Azure takes care of the underlying Kubernetes infrastructure.

**Note:** You need to pass the `location` in the where clause to query this table.

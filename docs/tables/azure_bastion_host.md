# Table: azure_bastion_host

Azure Bastion is a service you deploy that lets you connect to a virtual machine using your browser and the Azure portal, or via the native SSH or RDP client already installed on your local computer. The Azure Bastion service is a fully platform-managed PaaS service that you provision inside your virtual network. It provides secure and seamless RDP/SSH connectivity to your virtual machines directly from the Azure portal over TLS. When you connect via Azure Bastion, your virtual machines don't need a public IP address, agent, or special client software.

## Examples

### Basic info

```sql
select
  name,
  dns_name,
  provisioning_state,
  region,
  resource_group
from
  azure_bastion_host;
```

### List bastion hosts that are in failed state

```sql
select
  name,
  dns_name,
  provisioning_state,
  region,
  resource_group
from
  azure_bastion_host
where
  provisioning_state = 'Failed';
```

### Get subnet details associated with each host

```sql
select
  h.name as bastion_host_name,
  s.id as subnet_id,
  s.name as subnet_name,
  address_prefix
from
  azure_bastion_host h,
  jsonb_array_elements(ip_configurations) ip,
  azure_subnet s
where
  s.id = ip -> 'properties' -> 'subnet' ->> 'id';
```

### Get IP configuration details associated with each host

```sql
select
  h.name as bastion_host_name,
  i.name as ip_configuration_name,
  ip_configuration_id,
  ip_address,
  public_ip_allocation_method,
  sku_name as ip_configuration_sku
from
  azure_bastion_host h,
  jsonb_array_elements(ip_configurations) ip,
  azure_public_ip i
where
  i.id = ip -> 'properties' -> 'publicIPAddress' ->> 'id';

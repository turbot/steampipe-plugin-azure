# Azure + Steampipe

[Steampipe](https://steampipe.io) is an open source CLI to instantly query cloud APIs using SQL.

[Azure](https://azure.amazon.com/) provides on-demand cloud computing platforms and APIs to authenticated customers on a metered pay-as-you-go basis. 

For example:

```sql
select 
  display_name, 
  user_type 
from 
  azure_ad_user 
```

```
